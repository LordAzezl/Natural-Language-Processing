# Enhanced Question Answering Model

This repository implements an enhanced question-answering system using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model answers questions based on a given context, utilizing the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) for training and evaluation. This version includes improved code readability and structure while preserving functionality.

## Features

- Loads training and evaluation datasets in JSON format.
- Preprocesses data for training with tokenization and formatting.
- Trains a question-answering model with specified training arguments.
- Computes Intersection over Union (IoU) for evaluating predictions.
- Utilizes a pipeline for easy inference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
