## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. This repository showcases various NLP techniques and projects, providing insights into the capabilities and applications of NLP.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Implementations of various text classification algorithms.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Techniques for determining the sentiment expressed in text.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Language Modeling**: Experiments with different language models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis.

## Installation

To run the projects in this repository, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can install the required packages directly in the notebook.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own directory. To run a project, navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions in the README or notebook file within that directory. For example:

```bash
cd Text_Classification
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
